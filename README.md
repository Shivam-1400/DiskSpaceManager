# Disk Space Manager - Hackathon Project

The Disk Space Manager hackathon project created by Paras Guglani, Shivam Keshri, and Jigyasu Jain.

## Project Overview

The Disk Space Manager is an advanced disk management application that empowers users to efficiently manage their disk space. It provides comprehensive insights into space utilization, facilitates file detection, and offers capabilities to free up disk space.

## Essential Features

- Display the amount of free space available on the disk.
- Present the amount of space utilized on the disk.
- Provide a breakdown of space utilization based on drives, paths, and types of files (e.g., video, images, etc.).
- Detect duplicate files and enable their management.
- Identify large files that consume significant disk space.
- Allow users to delete files of specific types.
- Provide the capability to scan specific file types efficiently.
- Enable faster and efficient deletion of files and folders.
- Allow user to fetch files last used for given threshold number of days.

## Installation and Usage
Prerequisites
Before running the JavaFX project in Eclipse, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) - Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your system. You can download the latest JDK from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

Eclipse IDE - Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from the official Eclipse website.

JavaFX SDK - If you're using JDK 11 or later, JavaFX is not bundled with the JDK anymore. You'll need to download the JavaFX SDK separately from the Gluon website.

Importing the Project into Eclipse
Follow these steps to import the JavaFX project into Eclipse:

Open Eclipse IDE.

Go to "File" > "Open Projects from File System..."

Click "Directory" and browse to the location of your JavaFX project.

Click "Finish" to import the project into Eclipse.

Configuring JavaFX in Eclipse
If you're using JDK 8, JavaFX is included by default. However, for JDK 11 and later, you need to configure the JavaFX SDK in Eclipse:

Open Eclipse IDE.

Go to "Window" > "Preferences."

In the Preferences window, navigate to "Java" > "Build Path" > "User Libraries."

Click "New" and give your library a name, e.g., "JavaFX."

Select the "JavaFX" library and click "Add External JARs."

Browse to the location where you have the JavaFX SDK downloaded and select the "javafx-sdk/lib" folder.

Click "Apply and Close" to save the configuration.

Running the JavaFX Project
To run the JavaFX project in Eclipse, follow these steps:

Right-click on the main class of your JavaFX project.

Select "Run As" > "Java Application."

Eclipse will run the JavaFX application, and the JavaFX window should appear displaying the application's user interface.
